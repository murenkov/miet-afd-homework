The proposed power divider is composed of symmetrical modified T-shaped resonators, which are a replacement for quarter-wave transmission lines in the conventional structure. The proposed technique reduces the size of the power divider by 45\% and suppresses unwanted bands up to the fifth harmonics. To verify the concept, a prototype of the power divider has been fabricated and tested, exhibiting good agreement between the predicted and measured results. The results show that the insertion loss and the isolation at the center frequency are about 3.3 ± 0.1 dB and 23 dB, respectively.},

The isolation bandwidth can be extended by an additional isolation network (INW) in the circuits. An equal and an unequal 4-GHz modified Wilkinson power divider on FR4 with compact circuit sizes are designed and measured to verify the new design concept. The measurement results show the operation bandwidth from 1.8 to 6.4 GHz with 20-dB isolation in the equal case. In the unequal case, the operation frequency starts from 2.4 to 5.3 GHz with 20-dB isolation. Moreover, a 3-GHz 1-to-3 modified Wilkinson power divider is realized with the operation frequency from 2.05 to 3.83 GHz with 20-dB isolation. These circuits demonstrate that the isolation bandwidth can be extended by an INW, and this INW can be used in many power dividers with different applications. To the authors' knowledge, these circuits provide the widest fractional bandwidth of isolation in a Wilkinson power divider ever reported, except those using multisection structures.},

The DGS on the ground plane provides an additional effective inductive component to the microstrip line. This enables the microstrip line to be realized with very high impedance of over 150 /spl Omega/. By employing the DGS to the unequal Wilkinson topology, 4:1 power dividing ratio can be obtained easily without any problem in realization, while it has been impractical to fabricate a 4:1 divider using the conventional microstrip line because of very thin conductor width and extremely low aspect ratio (W/H). As an example, a 4:1 divider has been designed and measured at 1.5 GHz in order to show the validity of the proposed DGS and unequal divider. The measured performances of the 4:1 unequal power divider well agree with the exactly same dividing ratio as that expected.},

At first, its transmission, admittance, and scattering matrices are determined successively by considering the dispersion and dissipation models of substrate and metallic strips. An error function is then constructed for the desired output power division, maximum level of isolation between them, and the least amount of reflected power. Minimization of the error function with respect to the widths and lengths of strips and values of resistors provides their optimum values. A procedure is provided for the initial design and determination of initial values of parameters of a Wilkinson power divider based on the method of even- and odd-mode analysis. The optimum design of the Wilkinson power divider by the proposed MLS procedure is validated by available full-wave analysis software and fabrication and measurement of two samples.},

The transfer function of the asymmetric DGS shows signal rejection characteristics at two different resonance frequencies and the characteristics of asymmetric DGS is modeled by two parallel RLC resonance circuits in cascade. With the insertion of asymmetric spiral DGS into a quarter-wave line of the Wilkinson power divider, the second and third harmonics are suppressed simultaneously. In experimental results, 18-dB suppression for the second harmonic and 15-dB suppression for the third harmonic, respectively, are achieved. Using asymmetric DGS, the size of a quarter-wave line is reduced by 9.1~\% compared to that of the conventional divider without a DGS.},
